# TennisPlayerPredictor

## Work in progress
Initial idea is an app which based on scrapped tennis statistics can predict how well specific player will perform in each tournament. 

It's an academic project which in its final form should consist of the following:
1) Scrapping data website
2) Transforming extracted data and loading it into database
3) Using data to obtain from it some new knowledge through mathematical operations
4) Visualization of results
5) Generating log files
6) Generating raports containing results
